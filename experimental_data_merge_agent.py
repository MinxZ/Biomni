Experimental Data Merger Agent

This agent processes and merges experimental datasets from multiple researchers
with different naming conventions, missing data, and recording styles.
The agent must intelligently analyze and merge the data without prior knowledge
of the specific data structures.

    You have been given three experimental datasets from different researchers collected at different times.
    These datasets contain chemical/biological experimental data but were recorded by different people
    with different conventions, naming styles, and data recording practices.
    
    IMPORTANT: MEMORY MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE DATASETS
    - DO NOT load entire datasets into memory at once
    - Use pandas.read_csv() with chunksize parameter to read data in chunks
    - Process datasets in manageable portions (e.g., chunksize=1000 or 5000 rows)
    - Use iterator-based processing to handle large files efficiently
    - Only load the full dataset if you confirm it's small enough (<10MB or <50k rows)
    - For initial exploration, use pd.read_csv(nrows=100) to examine structure first
    
    YOUR MISSION:
    Intelligently analyze, process, and merge these three datasets into a single, unified, analysis-ready dataset.
    
    EXPECTED CHALLENGES (you need to discover and solve):
    - Different column naming conventions across datasets
    - Missing or incomplete data entries
    - Range values (like ">=10" or "<100") instead of exact measurements
    - Mixed languages/terms in column names
    - Different units or measurement scales
    - Inconsistent compound identification systems
    - Data quality issues from different recording practices
    - Large dataset sizes that require chunked processing
    
    REQUIREMENTS:
    1. **Data Discovery**: Load and thoroughly examine all three datasets using chunked reading
    2. **Structure Analysis**: Identify what each dataset contains and how they relate
    3. **Column Mapping**: Intelligently map similar columns across datasets (e.g., LogP vs logp vs lipophilicity_log)
    4. **Data Standardization**: 
       - Standardize column names to consistent naming convention
       - Handle range values and convert to usable numeric data where possible
       - Deal with missing data appropriately
       - Standardize units where needed
    5. **Intelligent Merging**: Merge the datasets using appropriate join strategies with chunked processing
    6. **Quality Assessment**: Provide comprehensive data quality metrics
    7. **Final Dataset**: Create a clean, analysis-ready merged dataset
    
    SUCCESS METRICS (KPIs):
    - Successfully merge all three datasets into one unified dataset
    - Achieve >95% compound coverage (minimize data loss during merge)
    - Standardize at least 80% of overlapping property columns
    - Handle all range values and missing data with documented strategies
    - Provide clear before/after statistics showing data improvement
    - Generate a comprehensive data quality and merging report
    - Save the final merged dataset as 'merged_experimental_data.csv'
    
    DELIVERABLES:
    1. Final merged dataset saved to file
    2. Data quality assessment report
    3. Column mapping and standardization documentation
    4. Before/after comparison statistics
    5. Recommendations for further data analysis
    
    You must figure out the optimal merging strategy based on the actual data content.
    Do not make assumptions - examine the data first to understand its structure and quality.
